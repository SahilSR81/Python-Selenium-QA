# Python-Selenium-QA
🚀 50 Days of Python + Selenium Automation (Daily GitHub Push)

## 📌 Objective

Build production-ready SDET skills by practicing daily, committing real code, solving real problems, and documenting real learnings.
This repository is a living log of my 50-day journey where:

I write code every day.
I break things every day.
I fix them every day.
I push to GitHub every day.

No tutorial dumping.
No fake projects.
Only execution. ⚙️

## 🧠 Why Python (Even Though I Know Java)

I started automation with Java.
Java taught me discipline, structure, and OOP thinking.

But while building test automation frameworks, I identified friction points:

❌ High boilerplate slowed iteration
❌ Longer feedback loops for test experimentation
❌ More code for the same automation intent

I chose Python as a force multiplier, not a shortcut:
✅ Faster test development
✅ Cleaner test readability (important for QA & Dev teams)
✅ Strong ecosystem: PyTest, Selenium, CI/CD
✅ Same OOP principles, less noise

Java gave me foundations.
Python gives me speed and leverage.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (50-Day Execution Plan)

The following topics will be implemented, not just learned:

### 🐍 Python Core

Advanced User Interactions
End-to-End Automation Scenarios

### 🧪 PyTest Framework

PyTest Basics
Fixtures
Parameterization
Annotations & CLI Arguments
HTML & Custom Reports

### 🧱 Framework Design

Logging (Python Logging / Log4j-style)
Page Object Model (POM)
End-to-End Framework from Scratch
Data-Driven Framework (Excel)

### 📊 Utilities & Integrations
